This is an IntelliJ IDEA project. 

To run the app, simply clone the project, open it in IntelliJ and run it using the IDE.

You only need JavaFX - https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/javafx.html

Also, the project uses an external library GSON which is included in the project (gson-2.8.2.jar). Add it in the "Project Structure" in IntelliJ as a local or global library.
